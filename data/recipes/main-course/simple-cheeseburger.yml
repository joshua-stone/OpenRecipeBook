directions:
- step: Preheat cast iron skillet

- step: Cook patty for about 2 minutes (or more depending on desired level of doneness), then flip both patty and onion slice with spatula
- step: Quickly place extra sharp cheddar on the top of the burger so it can begin to melt
- step: Cook patty for another two minutes, spooning lard on top of the burger to promote cheese melting
  note: Tilting the skillet helps for liquids to pool at the bottom for easier scooping
- step: After another 2 minutes (or more depending on desired level of doneness), remove both patty and onion slice and place on cutting board to rest
  note: Be sure to place burger near center of cutting board to catch all juices that flow out
